# Contributing to Lambda Docs

Thank you for considering contributing to
[Lambda Docs](https://docs.lambdalabs.com)! We welcome contributions of all
forms, including bug reports, requests for new documentation, and pull requests.
Below are guidelines to ensure a quick and easy contribution process.

## Bug reports, improvements, and new documentation

If you find any issues with the documentation (for example, outdated content,
broken links, or broken styling), or have suggestions for improvements or new
documentation, please create an issue in GitHub.

## Pull requests

If you want to create a pull request (thank you!) to fix a bug, improve existing
documentation, or contribute new documentation, we recommend that you first
create an issue in GitHub. This reduces the likelihood that you and someone else
are duplicating efforts.

Please follow the guidelines below when creating a pull request:

- **Write in Markdown**. Use HTML only when necessary.
- **Format external links and links to PDFs**.
    - External links should be formatted as follows: `[LINK TEXT
      :octicons-link-external-16:](URL){target="_blank"}`. This formatting
      appends
      <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="0.75em" height="1em" viewBox="0 0 12 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M11 10h1v3c0 .55-.45 1-1 1H1c-.55 0-1-.45-1-1V3c0-.55.45-1 1-1h3v1H1v10h10v-3zM6 2l2.25 2.25L5 7.5L6.5 9l3.25-3.25L12 8V2H6z" fill="currentColor"/></svg>
      the link text to indicate an external link. The link will also open in a
      new tab.
    - Links to PDFs should be formatted as:
      `[:material-file-pdf-box: LINK TEXT](URL){target="_blank"}`. This
      formatting prefaces the link text with
      <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="1em" height="1em" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19 3H5c-1.1 0-2 .9-2 2v14c0 1.1.9 2 2 2h14c1.1 0 2-.9 2-2V5c0-1.1-.9-2-2-2m-9.5 8.5c0 .8-.7 1.5-1.5 1.5H7v2H5.5V9H8c.8 0 1.5.7 1.5 1.5zm5 2c0 .8-.7 1.5-1.5 1.5h-2.5V9H13c.8 0 1.5.7 1.5 1.5zm4-3H17v1h1.5V13H17v2h-1.5V9h3zm-6.5 0h1v3h-1zm-5 0h1v1H7z"/></svg>
      to indicate the link is to a PDF. When linking to a PDF, don't preface the
      link text with `:octicons-link-external-16:` even if the link is to an
      external site.
- **Adhere to the Microsoft Style Guide**. Please try your best to adhere to the
  [Microsoft Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/)
  the best you can. However, don't let this discourage you from contributing.
  We're happy to help edit your work!
- **Wrap lines at 80 characters**. Treat links and images as single words: if a
  link or image causes a line to exceed 80 characters in length, wrap it to a
  new line. **Note**: It doesn't always make sense to wrap lines at 80
  characters. Do what you think is best, keeping readability in mind.
