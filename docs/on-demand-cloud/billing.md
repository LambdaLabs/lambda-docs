# Billing

## How are on-demand instances billed?

Before you can launch on-demand instances, you need to add a credit card to
your account using the dashboard. We'll make a $10 pre-authorization charge to
make sure the card is valid, similar to how gas stations and hotels do. The
charge will be refunded in a few days.

[On-demand instances](https://lambdalabs.com/service/gpu-cloud) are billed in one-minute increments from the moment you
spin up (start) the instance up to the moment you terminate (stop) the
instance.

!!! danger "Be sure to terminate any instances that you're not using!"

    You will be billed for all minutes that an instance is running, even if
    the instance isn't actively being used.

The GPU Cloud dashboard allows you to view your resource usage.

Invoices are sent weekly for the previous week's usage.

!!! note "On-Demand Cloud vs. Reserved Cloud"

    On-demand instances require us to maintain excess capacity at all times so
    we can meet the changing workloads of our customers. For this reason,
    on-demand instances are priced higher than reserved instances.

    Conversely, we offer reserved GPU Cloud instances at a significant savings
    over on-demand instances, since they allow us to more accurately determine
    our capacity needs ahead of time.

## How are file systems billed?

File systems are billed per GB used per month, in increments of 1 hour.

For example, based on the price of $0.20 per GB used per month:

* If you use 1,000 GB of your file system capacity for an entire month (30
  days, or 720 hours), you'll be billed $200.00.
* If you use 1,000 GB of your file system capacity for a single day
  (24 hours), you'll be billed $6.67.

!!! note "Actual price of persistent storage"

    The actual price of persistent storage will be displayed when you create
    your file system.

## How do I change my payment method and billing address?

[Use the dashboard to change your payment method and billing address](https://cloud.lambdalabs.com/settings/billing).

## Do I have to pay sales tax for usage of Lambda GPU Cloud?

Sales tax is charged for usage of Lambda GPU Cloud.

The sales tax you're charged is based on the billing address associated with
your account. For this reason, it's important that you always
[keep your billing address up to date](https://cloud.lambdalabs.com/settings)
using the Cloud dashboard.

!!! note "Billing addresses outside of the United States"

    If you enter a _business_ billing address outside the United States,
    you'll need to fill in the **VAT/GST #** field.

    [See the European Commission's FAQs](https://taxation-customs.ec.europa.eu/vat-identification-numbers\_en)
    to learn more about VAT identification numbers.

!!! danger "Can't launch instances without a billing address"

    You won't be able to launch new instances if you don't have a billing
    address associated with your account.

## Why is my card being declined?

Common reasons why card transactions are declined include:

### The card is a prepaid card or debit card

We don't accept debit cards or prepaid cards. We only accept major credit
cards.

### The purchase is being made from a country we don't support

We currently only support customers in the following regions:

* United States
* Canada
* Chile
* Iceland
* United Arab Emirates
* Saudi Arabia
* South Africa
* Israel
* Taiwan
* South Korea
* Japan
* Singapore
* Australia
* New Zealand
* United Kingdom
* Switzerland
* European Union (except for Romania)

### The purchase is being made while you're connected to a VPN

Purchases made while using a VPN are flagged as suspicious.

### The card issuer is denying our pre-authorization charge

We make a $10 pre-authorization charge to a card before accepting it for
payment. If the card issuer denies the pre-authorization charge, then we can't
accept the card for payment.

### Wrong CVV or ZIP Code is being entered

Card purchases won't go through if the CVV (security code) is entered
incorrectly. Also, card purchases will be denied if the ZIP Code doesn't match
with the card billing address.

If none of these are applicable to you,
[contact the Lambda Support team](https://support.lambdalabs.com/hc/en-us/requests/new)
for help.

## What happens to my account if I don't pay an invoice?

!!! danger "Unpaid invoices result in account suspension"

    If an [invoice](#how-are-on-demand-instances-billed) remains unpaid after
    we've made 4 attempts to charge the card on file, we may suspend your
    account.

    If your account is suspended, your running instances may be terminated and
    your files may be deleted without prior notice.

    Eventually, all of your instances will be terminated and all of your
    persistent storage file systems will be deleted.

    Your account will be permanently banned from Lambda GPU Cloud. Your
    account will be referred for collection. Legal action may be taken against
    you.

## How are refunds given?

Refunds are given in the form of credit toward future Cloud usage only. The
credit can't be redeemed for cash (for example, refund to a card) and can't be
used toward purchases of other Lambda products.

The credit expires 12 months after it is given.

The credit is nontransferable and is subject to the
[Lambda Cloud Terms of Service](https://lambdalabs.com/legal/terms-of-service#cloud-terms-of-service).

## Can you provide an estimate of how much a job will cost?

We can't estimate how much your job will cost or how long it'll take to
complete on one of our instances. This is because we don't know the details of
your job, such as how your program works.

However, the performance of our instances is close to what you'd expect from
bare metal machines with the same GPUs.

In order to estimate how much your job will cost or how long it'll take to
complete, we suggest you create an instance and benchmark your program.

!!! tip "Check out our GPU benchmarks"

    [Check out our GPU benchmarks](https://lambdalabs.com/gpu-benchmarks) to
    form a general idea of the performance provided by our instances. Keep in
    mind that real-world performance doesn't always match the performance
    provided by benchmarks.
