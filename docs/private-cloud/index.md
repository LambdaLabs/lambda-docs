# Introduction

Lambda Private Cloud provides bare metal, single-tenant clusters for defined reservation periods. Lambda builds the cluster to your specifications and hosts it in a secure Lambda data center, providing support for the cluster hardware and firewall. You have sole access to your cluster and firewall. Lambda can additionally provide managed services, like [Managed Kubernetes](/managed-kubernetes/index.md).
