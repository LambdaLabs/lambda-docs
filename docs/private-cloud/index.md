# Introduction

Lambda Private Cloud provides bare metal, single-tenant clusters for defined reservation periods. Lambda builds the cluster to your specifications. Lambda hosts the cluster in a SSAE 18 SOC I, Type II-certified, PCI Compliant data center, providing 24x7 support for the cluster hardware. Access to the cluster and firewall are restricted solely to you. Lambda can additionally provide managed services, like [Managed Kubernetes](/managed-kubernetes/index.md).
