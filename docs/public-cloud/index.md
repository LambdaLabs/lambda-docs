# Introduction

In today’s fast-paced tech landscape, the need for powerful, high-performance
computing is more critical than ever. Whether you're working on AI and machine
learning, complex data analysis, or rendering detailed graphics, the demand
for robust computational power is undeniable. Traditional CPUs can struggle
with these tasks, which is where Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) step in,
offering the parallel processing capabilities required for these modern
applications.

However, investing in top-tier GPU hardware can be costly and challenging to
scale. That’s where GPU cloud providers come in. Offering on-demand access to
cutting-edge GPU resources, these cloud services give you the power and
flexibility you need without the hefty upfront costs.
