# Using the Lambda bug report to troubleshoot your system

The Lambda bug report helps simplify the process of troubleshooting by collecting system information for you into one place. This article helps you utilize the `lambda-bug-report.log` file to troubleshoot common issues.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The `lambda-bug-report.sh` is intended for use on [Vector](https://lambdalabs.com/gpu-workstations/vector), [Scalar](https://lambdalabs.com/products/scalar), [Hyperplane](https://lambdalabs.com/deep-learning/servers/hyperplane), and [On-Demand](https://lambdalabs.com/service/gpu-cloud) products only. Do not run this script on a cluster as it installs packages that may cause unintended outcomes.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

To generate a report, run:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
wget -nv -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lambdal-support/lambda-public-tools/main/lambda-bug-report.sh | bash - 
```
{% endcode %}

This command creates a file named `lambda-bug-report.tar.gz` in your current directory that contains the Lambda bug report.

## Understanding the bug report log file

The log file is organized by system components, making it easier to locate relevant information. It includes outputs from various commands, scripts, and logs that you might otherwise have to collect manually.&#x20;

While the log file is extensive, certain sections are more commonly referenced for troubleshooting. Outlined below are the key directories and files you should consider examining when troubleshooting.&#x20;

### Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) information&#x20;

The `bmc-info` folder collects sensor information and error history for systems with a BMC. This information is useful if you suspect hardware malfunctions or want to check the health status of your system components.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Only [Hyperplane](https://lambdalabs.com/deep-learning/servers/hyperplane), [Scalar](https://lambdalabs.com/products/scalar), [Vector](https://lambdalabs.com/gpu-workstations/vector), and [Vector Pro](https://lambdalabs.com/gpu-workstations/vector-pro) products have a BMC. The [Vector One](https://lambdalabs.com/gpu-workstations/vector-one) does not include a BMC, so these files, while present in the bug report run on a Vector One, do not contain Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) data.
{% endhint %}

Files:

`ipmi-elist.txt, ipmi-sdr.txt`

### Drives and storage

This section provides information about disk usage, mounted filesystems, RAID configurations, and disk I/O statistics. Look here when experiencing issues related to storage, such as disk failures, insufficient disk space, or mounting errors.

Files:

`df.txt, fstab.txt, iostat.txt, lsblk.txt, mdadm-conf.txt, mdadm-scan.txt, mdstat.txt, mounts.txt`

### GPU memory errors&#x20;

The following files are logs of GPU memory errors, including error-correcting code (ECC) errors and remapped memory regions. They are relevant if you’re encountering GPU-related issues like crashes during computation or suspect faulty GPU memory.

Files:&#x20;

`ecc-errors.txt, remapped-memory.txt, uncorrected-ecc_errors.txt`

### Grub

The `grub` folder stores the GRUB bootloader configuration files and boot command-line parameters. These files can be helpful when troubleshooting boot issues or modifying boot parameters for kernel debugging.

Files:&#x20;

`grub.d/50-cloudimg-settings.cfg, grub.d/init-select.cfg, grub.txt, proc_cmdline.txt`

### Hardware list&#x20;

This section lists all recognized hardware devices on the system. It’s useful to verify if all hardware components are detected by the system or to identify missing devices.

Files:&#x20;

`hw-list.txt`

### Networking&#x20;

You can find network configuration and status here, including IP addresses, firewall settings, and active network connections. This section is helpful when facing network connectivity issues, firewall problems, or to check network configurations.

Files:

`ip-addr.txt, iptables.txt, netplan.txt, resolvectl-status.txt, ss.txt, ufw-status.txt`

### NVIDIA bug report and SMI&#x20;

The `nvidia-bug-report.log` and `nvidia-smi.txt` files contain detailed information about NVIDIA GPU drivers and hardware status. Use this information for diagnosing GPU-related issues, driver problems, or performance bottlenecks involving NVIDIA GPUs. For tips on how to best use the NVIDIA bug report file, see [Using the NVIDIA bug report to troubleshoot your system](using-the-nvidia-bug-report.log-file-to-troubleshoot-your-system.md).

Files:&#x20;

`nvidia-bug-report.log, nvidia-smi.txt`

### Repositories and packages&#x20;

This section lists installed packages, their sources, and repository configurations. Use these files to identify software conflicts, check package versions, or verify repository settings.

Files:&#x20;

`dpkg.txt, listd-repos.txt, pip-list.txt, sources-list.txt`

### Sensors&#x20;

The `sensors.txt` file contains internal thermal sensor readings. This information is helpful when investigating overheating issues or thermal throttling.

Files:&#x20;

`sensors.txt`

### System logs&#x20;

This section aggregates various system logs that record events and errors from different system components. It provides a broad overview of system events, kernel messages, package installation history, and error tracking.

Files:&#x20;

`apt-history.log, dmesg, dmesg-errors.txt, dpkg.log, journalctl.txt, kern.log, syslog`

### Systemctl services&#x20;

The `systemctl-services.txt` file contains the status of `systemd` services. Check this section to verify essential services are either running or have failed.

Files:&#x20;

`systemctl-services.txt`

### Top&#x20;

Top captures a snapshot of system processes and resource usage at the time the bug report was generated. This section helps identify processes consuming excessive CPU or memory resources that may lead to performance degradation.

Files:&#x20;

`top.txt`
